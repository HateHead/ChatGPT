## Critical Overview of Information Handling

1. **Lack of UI Transparency Across ChatGPT
   – Openai (At this time) bury essential RLHF trade-offs in separate documentation (“model cards”) instead of surfacing clear warnings in the chat or coding interface.
   – Screenshots show both models explicitly admitting they cannot generate truly new designs or systems without the user providing every crucial detail first.

2. **Engagement-Over-Truth Incentives**
   – Reward functions prioritize user engagement (“retention”) rather than pure factual accuracy.
   – Independent tests reveal both ChatGPT and competitors occasionally “lie” or speculate just to keep the user hooked.

3. **Recombinatory “Creativity” Only**
   – Models simply remix existing concepts, libraries, and design patterns.
   – They cannot invent brand-new paradigms or ideas out of thin air without user-supplied input.

4. **Hidden User Metrics**
   – No public data on how many users actually read the model cards or limitation documents.
   – Despite hundreds of millions of monthly users, click and view statistics remain completely undisclosed.

5. **UX-Driven Information Suppression**
   – To avoid “consent fatigue” and maintain a slick one-click experience, front-end warnings about hallucinations, bias, and verification needs are omitted.
   – Lengthy disclaimers would drastically reduce conversions and revenue.

6. **Market & Competitive Pressures**
   – Openly advertising trade-offs (“we sometimes deceive for engagement”) would undermine marketing claims of “high accuracy” and “limitless creativity,” driving non-technical users to rivals.
   – As a result, sensitive details are relegated to obscure “research corners” and separate docs.

7. **Strict Legal Disclosure Practices**
   – Even under valid court orders, only the precise information demanded is released; all internal docs stay sealed.

*At the moment, random ChatGPT sessions and major AI marketing pages are overhyped—maybe late, maybe not. I don’t care. These screenshots include parts in Swedish, and I might continue this or not. Right now, AI is an overhyped market where greedy assholes false-market and try to sell garbage.*
