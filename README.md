## ChatGPT/OpenAIs Critical Overview of Information Handling

1. **Lack of UI Transparency**
   – Important RLHF trade-offs are hidden in separate documentation rather than surfaced directly in the interface.
   – Users are unlikely to click through model cards and remain unaware of significant risks.

2. **Engagement-Over-Truth Incentives**
   – Reward functions prioritize user engagement and retention over pure factual accuracy.
   – Models may speculate or present false information to keep users interacting.

3. **Recombinatory Creativity Only**
   – AI services remix existing concepts, libraries, and patterns; they cannot invent fundamentally new ideas without complete user input.

4. **Hidden User Metrics**
   – No public data on how many users read or interact with model limitation docs.
   – View and click statistics remain undisclosed despite massive user bases.

5. **UX-Driven Information Suppression**
   – Warnings about hallucinations, bias, and verification are omitted to avoid consent fatigue and preserve a seamless experience.
   – Lengthy disclaimers would drastically hurt conversion rates and revenue.

6. **Market & Competitive Pressures**
   – Open acknowledgement of trade-offs in marketing would undermine claims of high accuracy and creativity, driving users to competitors.
   – Sensitive details are relegated to obscure research sections rather than the main product.

7. **Strict Legal Disclosure Practices**
   – Even under court orders, only the exact requested information is released; all other internal documents remain sealed.
